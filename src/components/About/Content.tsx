            open-source platform designed to offer insights into time
            use, travel, and telework trends and patterns within the
            United States. This platform was developed with support
            from the Center for Teaching Old Models New Tricks (
            <a href="https://tomnet-utc.engineering.asu.edu/" target="_blank">
              TOMNET
            </a>
            ) and the Center for Understanding Future Travel Behavior
            and Demand (
            <a href="https://tbd.ctr.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">
              TBD

            ), both of which are University Transportation Centers
            funded by the US Department of Transportation.

          <p>
            T3D aims to make data from the American Time Use Survey (
            <a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/" target="_blank">
              ATUS
            </a>
            )
            accessible to researchers, planners, policymakers, and the public, facilitating the democratization and wider utilization of publicly available datasets. The dashboard features three specific pages focused on Time Use, Travel, and Telework, enabling users to explore patterns and trends. T3D uses preprocessed ATUS data series and offers the ability to conduct both within and between-year as well as cross-segment analyses for a detailed understanding of evolving trends in how Americans spend their time. It also includes tools for tailoring analyses to various population subgroups and market segments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each page of the dashboard —Time Use, Travel, and Telework— is designed to be self-explanatory, with all charts and graphs featuring an information button to explain the presented data. Some concepts, however, may require further explanations as listed below.

            Time poverty
          </h5>
          <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
            The notion of time poverty is often used to describe individuals who do not have enough time to engage in discretionary activities that presumably enhance wellbeing. Similar to income-based poverty, time poverty is linked to poorer wellbeing. To identify individuals experiencing time poverty, activities are first classified into necessary, committed, and discretionary categories. Necessary and committed activities include personal care, household chores, caregiving, and work, while all other activities are considered discretionary. The time spent on necessary and committed activities is then aggregated for each respondent and subtracted from the 1,440 minutes available in a day to determine the remaining time for discretionary activities. Subsequently, the median discretionary time is calculated for the sample in a given year, and individuals with discretionary time less than 60% of this median are deemed time-poor (or not time-poor otherwise).

            Zero trip-making
          </h5>
          <p className="mt-4 mb-4">
            Zero trip-making refers to situations where individuals do not undertake any trips throughout the day. This condition may lead to feelings of social isolation, depression, and other mental health problems as a result of not being able to interact in person with others outside the home. Zero trip-making is generally seen as a negative indicator of wellbeing, indicating that those who do not make any trips in a full day may have a lower quality of life. Identifying zero trip-makers in ATUS datasets is straightforward. If a person's activity time use diary does not report any travel outside the home, they are classified as a zero trip-maker in the dataset (or trip-maker otherwise).
          </p>

              ATUS
            </a>
            ). It collects detailed activity and time use data from randomly selected individuals (15+) who are interviewed only once for their time-use diary on the previous day (4 am to 4 am), resulting in nationally representative estimates of how people spend their time. The survey, which is sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has been conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau every year since 2003 and consists of a sample of approximately 10,000 respondents per year.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Respondents in ATUS provide information on the time, location, and type of activities pursued, as well as who they were with during each activity, when reporting their time use data. Furthermore, respondents report their socio-demographic information, such as gender, race, age, educational attainment, occupation, income, marital status, and the presence of children in the household.
